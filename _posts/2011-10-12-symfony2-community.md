Symfony2 is the best framework I know: whether you want to build the most complex applications or the simplest ones, it perfectly fits the bill. You can be sure that your code will be faster, easy to read, constantly maintainable by other community members, scalable, ... the list of its advantages goes on and on. Symfony2 is a great community with experts and novices.

In this post I want to thank @fabpot, and in fact, not just him but the entire Symfony2 community for teaching developers some great philosophies and also some good principles. So keep up the good work!

As an early adopter, I started working on Symfony2 a-year-and-a-half ago and never since then have had to regret my decision. It has been a great pleasure to work with the community and I'm still working on multiple Symfony2 projects.

__Long life to Symfony2 and its community !__
