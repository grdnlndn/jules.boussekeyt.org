Symfony2 is the best framework I know, with it you can build the most complex application and also the smallest one. You can be sure that your code will be fast, easy to read, maintainable by other people, scalable, ... Symfony2 is a great community with experts and novices.

In this post I want to thank @fabpot, not just him but the whole Symfony2 community for teaching to developers some great philosophies and also some good principles. So keep up the good work!

As an early adopter, I started to work on Symfony2 one year and a half ago and never have to regret it, it has been a big pleasure to work with and I still work on Symfony2 projects.

__Long life to Symfony2 and his community !__
