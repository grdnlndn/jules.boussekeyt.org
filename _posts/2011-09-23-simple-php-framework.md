Frameworks are great, they help you to build things fast, secured and maintainable. They provide you tools to do things sometimes you don't want to do by yourself, like authentication, forms, ORM .. 

As a good programmer you want more and more control and you can't let other third party libs manage your code, you want to keep an eye on your code and keep the technical level up to maintain your application. 

_Fox exemple frameworks do all the work for authentication mechanisms, 
but if one day you work on a project from scratch 
will you be able to create the authentication mechanism yourself ?_

I've created a project called `SimpleFramework`, it's a framework, nothing more. `SimpleFramework` wants to be as small as possible, features are minimal: templating, routing, controller, .. SimpleFramework doesn't want to do all the work for you, you are the real conductor of your project!
